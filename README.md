# Rendering-Code

WebGL work to learn rendering concepts. This was completed for a Real Time Rendering course at The Ohio State University. Some code was provided by Han-Wei Shen and TA Yi Tang Chen provided the OBJ loader for Lab 5


Quick Overview of each file:
Lab 1 - button presses (Q, V, H, P) render different shapes onto the screen
Lab 2 - button presses (Q, T, L, P, O) render objects on the screen. The most recently rendered object can be translated with keystrokes (W, A, S, D).
Lab 3 - heirarchical transformations. A readme provides controls
Lab 3_2 - heirarchical transformations and rendering 3D objects instead o 2D. A readme provides controls
Lab 4 - phoung shading implementation. A readme provides controls
Lab 5 - includes lighting, heirarchical transformations, and texture rendering
