I did not change any of the keystroke controls for simplicity sake. I simply recreated the shape and added in 'nunchucks' for my ninja robot to display that I knew how to deal with the heirarchical operations.

To reiterate, for layout (such as the keystroke listener and helper functions/function setup) I did use a lot of Prof. Han-Wei Shen's xform example(s). However I did remake my own robot from the ground up (not counting keystrokes) to display the knowledge required for this lab - heirarchical transformations.

To control the robot:
'r' - Makes the arms rotate as well as makes the ninja bot spin his nunchucks.

'R' - Rotates the entire ninja bot

'e' - Makes the hands spin, the nunchucks will spin with the hands.

's' - Scales all of the ninja down

'S' - Scales all of the ninja up

'x' - Translates the ninja left

'X' - Translated the ninja right

'y' - Translates the ninja down

'Y' - Translates the ninja up
